# Task 1 â€“ Network Port Scanning

## Objective
To discover open ports on devices in the local network using Nmap, and optionally analyze traffic using Wireshark.

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Wireshark

## Steps Followed
1. Identified local IP range.
2. Ran Nmap TCP SYN scan using:
   
## nmap command
3. Captured packets using Wireshark.
4. Applied TCP SYN filter:

## tcp.flags.syn == 1 for filter
5. Exported results and screenshots.

## Files Included
- `scan_result.txt`: Nmap output
- `nmap.png`: Screenshot of packet capture
- `task11.pcapng`: Raw capture file

## Outcome
Learned basic network scanning and how to analyze port exposure using tools.
